** Features:

** Implementation
** Convenience:
- additional actions upon items beside classical file management
- - offer to access the gallery3 web surface directly for certain tasks
- - support the ordering of items as used by gallery3
** Startup speed:
- multiple slaves started at the same time still have to keep a full copy (cache)
of the remote item hierarchy structure by themselves. The hierarchy is required
due to the logic of the Gallery3 REST API which is clean, crunchy, logical and
extensible but doent easily offer itself for a deep access by path into the items
hierarchy. Sharing the hierarchy cache between all concurrent slaves might solve
this in future, maybe by using an additional 'kded module'.
** Preview: 
- use remotely existing thumbnails inside kde preview logic
- - dont download full size item and generate a new thumbnail
- - download remotely existing thumbnail instead and use that
- - might required an additional plugin to the kio-thumbnail slave
** Issues:
