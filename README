Overview:
kio-gallery3 implements two kio-slaves, protocols for KDEs I/O system. It 
makes the content of a remote gallery3 server available inside the local 
file management. That means you can access all items contained in the 
gallery entries using standard file dialogs like 'File open' or 'Save File', 
you even can use a file browser and add or access existing entries. In general
you can use the slaves wherever you can use an URL inside KDE to get access to
the gallery3 content. There are no temporary file generated.

Warranty: 
This software comes with no warranties. Use it at own risk.
kio-clipboard was developed and tested under KDE-4.6 running on a GNU/Linux
(openSUSE) on a x86_64 platform. I hope it works under other platforms and
environments.

State:
This is an early and definitely buggy release. 

Roadmap: 
- complete support of gallery3s API

Usage:
Just enter "gallery3:/<my.server.org>/<gallery-folder>" in the location bar of 
for example dolphin or a "File open" dialog.
gallery3s:/<my.server.org>/<gallery-folder> serves the same purpose but uses 
https to access the gallery. Prefer this if you have https access.
