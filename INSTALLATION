OVERVIEW
The installation is pretty easy. There is no build-time
dependency on gallery since to us it is a remote server 
API. If it changes, you are screwed, but this should not 
happen, as it is official and other programs will rely 
on it as well.

REQUIREMENTS
KDE>=4.5
Qt4

INSTALLATION FROM BINARY PACKAGE
If you have a precompiled package matching your system
(architecture and distribution) installation is handled
by the standard tool that comes with the distribution.

BUILD AND INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
# in the source directory:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install

[sudo make uninstall]

That's it.
You might want to add shortcuts for easier access at a
few places, for example dolphins 'places' sidebar, once 
you have successfully connected to your gallery. 

USAGE PREREQUISITES
Obviously you do need a remote gallery3 server you have access to.
That server must have the "rest" module enabled. This module provides
the RESTful API used by this slave implementation. Please refer to
the gallery3 documentation about this.
