Overview: 
The installation is pretty easy. There is no build-time dependency on Gallery3
since to us it is a remote RESTful API. If that one changes, you are screwed,
but this should not happen, as it is official and stable, other programs rely
on it as well.

Requirements: 
KDE>=4.7
Qt4
QJson

Installation from a binary package: 
If you have a precompiled package matching your system (architecture and
distribution) installation is handled by the standard tool that comes with
the distribution.

Build and install from source: 
# in the unpacked sources directory:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install
[sudo make uninstall]

That's it.
You might want to add shortcuts for easier access at a few places, for example
dolphins 'places' sidebar, once you have successfully connected to your gallery. 
Prefer the 'gallery3s' protocol in favour of 'gallery3' whenever possible to
take advantage of its encryption of sensitive information. 

Usage prerequisites: 
Obviously you do need a remote Gallery3 system you have access to.
That server must have the 'REST' module enabled. This module provides
the RESTful API used by this slave implementation. Please refer to
the gallery3 documentation about this.
It is not required to grant guest access to the API, in fact the makers of
Gallery3 advise against that. kio-gallery3 will try authenticated access when
required. This is done by prompting the user for authentication credentials
and an explicit login to the Gallery3 API. 
Read-only ("show-only") access to a Gallery3 certainly does not required an
authenticated session, so for certain purposes you might want to enable the
guest access to the API.
